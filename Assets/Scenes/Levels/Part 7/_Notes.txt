Part 6 (Ending):
Scenes:
    7_1_Execution_Credits

Story Layout:
The hanging
After unfolding to. Black we see Kate walking up to the gallows. Could maybe have a monologue. Seeing her son watching etc. game ends as the lever is pulled.

Credits with one of her folk songs maybe as discussed.
I have tried to leave it mostly open in terms of how each scene plays out, dialogue and how we approach each scene. Which we would have to discuss. Any issues or additions you feel should be added put it in the channel below as this is definitely not set in stone.
