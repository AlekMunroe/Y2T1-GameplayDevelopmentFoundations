Part 6 (Aftermath):
Scenes:
    6_1_JailCell
    6_2_ThomasHouse

Story Layout:
In the jail cell, Kate admits everything going into detail about the murder 
(My idea here is play as Thomas while kate narrates leading to a scary experience where the player knows there going to be murder.)
Can experiment with this as the details of the murder are unknown
